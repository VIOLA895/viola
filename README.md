PORTFOLIO
1. Overview of Deployment

Project Name: Viola Kambuni Portfolio
Hosting Platform: Vercel
Purpose of Deployment: The primary goal of deploying this project on Vercel is to provide a live, accessible portfolio website showcasing Viola Kambuni's skills, projects, and contact information for potential clients, collaborators, or employers.

2. Why Vercel?

      Easy Deployment and Hosting

Vercel offers a seamless deployment process that allows developers to deploy their web applications with just a few clicks. It integrates directly with GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket, enabling continuous deployment for every push to the repository.                                                                                                                                                              

Serverless Functions

Vercel allows you to write serverless functions that run in response to HTTP requests. This is perfect for handling backend logic without managing your own servers, which simplifies scaling and reduces operational costs.

 Optimized for Frontend Frameworks

Vercel is optimized for frameworks like Next.js (which is also developed by the Vercel team), React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, and more. It provides special features and optimizations tailored to these frameworks.

3. Deployment Workflow

GitHub Integration:

The project is maintained in a GitHub repository. Vercel is directly connected to this repository, allowing for continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD).
When a change is committed and pushed to the main (or another specified) branch in the GitHub repository, Vercel detects the change and triggers an automatic deployment.
Build Process:

Vercel automatically detects the build settings. For this project, as it is a static site with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, Vercel deploys it without needing additional build steps.
Vercel optimizes the deployment process to ensure fast and reliable builds.
Environment Configuration:

Vercel allows adding environment variables for different deployment environments (e.g., development, production). In this case, environment variables like API keys for services such as EmailJS can be managed securely through Vercel's dashboard.

4. Hosting Features Provided by Vercel

Global CDN (Content Delivery Network):

The project is served via Vercelâ€™s global CDN, ensuring that users from different geographic locations experience fast loading times. The static assets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images) are cached and served from the closest server to the user.
Automatic SSL Certificates:

Vercel provides free SSL certificates via Let's Encrypt, ensuring that the site is always accessed over HTTPS, which is crucial for security and SEO.
Custom Domain Management:

Vercel offers custom domain management, allowing you to link a custom domain (e.g., www.violakambuni.com) to your Vercel project. This enhances branding and provides a more professional appearance.
Serverless Functions:

Although the current version of the project does not utilize serverless functions, Vercel supports deploying backend logic as serverless functions that scale automatically with demand. This can be useful for future enhancements.

5. Benefits of Using Vercel for This Project

Automatic Performance Optimization: Vercel automatically optimizes assets like images and JavaScript to ensure fast load times, which is critical for a portfolio website to retain visitors.
Zero Configuration: With minimal configuration needed, deploying changes is straightforward. This ease of use allows developers to focus on the project rather than on deployment complexities.
Scalability: Vercel's architecture automatically scales with traffic, ensuring that the site can handle varying loads without manual intervention or additional cost.
Preview Deployments: Vercel provides preview deployments for every push to a branch other than the main branch. This is useful for testing new features or changes in a staging environment before making them live.
Integrated Analytics: Vercel offers built-in analytics that provides insights into page views, unique visits, and other metrics, helping you understand user engagement and optimize the site accordingly.

6. Deployment Considerations and Improvements

Monitoring and Alerts: Set up Vercel alerts to get notified if a deployment fails or if there are issues with the site.
Custom Domain and SEO: If not already done, consider linking a custom domain to your Vercel project and optimizing it for SEO to enhance discoverability.
Leveraging Serverless Functions: Future enhancements could include using Vercel's serverless functions to handle dynamic features, like enhanced form submissions or integrating a backend service.
